NOTE: Make sure you READ THIS before e-mailing me about ANYTHING ...

NOTE2: Feel free to e-mail me about bugs found, or how you liked it. BUT DO NOT, AND I MEAN NOT, GIVE ME SUGGESTIONS ON WHAT TO IMPROVE ON... yet. But this can be discussed in the ZGTEAM FORUMS, because I don't want my e-mail box blowing up! And the bugs that I already know of is already found mentioned below, don't mention it to me again.
-----------
Version 1.1 new stuff:
-----------
Nothing :P - but a crap load of bug fixes ^__^

-----------
What's in:
-----------
- Fly
- KI Barrier
- A newly developed beam attack [1st time using a helper to do it ^__^]
- Combos
- 3 Realistic Sounds from the Anime [No not voices] 
- Armor Mode [a little buggy tho]
- Teleport
- Custom edited sprites from the Android 17 
- Cancel Combos to chain more combos in
- 1 Pallete [bah, I hate having lots!]
- A fireball that does massive damage and a massive explosion
- 1 Little [and also my 1st] Meteor Attack ^__^ [not very impressive but...]

------------
Known Bugs:
------------
- Some moves repeat themselves when you do them, because of the armor code. DO NOT E-MAIL ME ABOUT IT, I AM AWARE OF SUCH A BUG!!!
- Altho the sprites ARE aligned properly, some seem out of place. I'm searching for why still.
- Oddly, Android 17 duplicates himself ONCE in a while ... I haven't discovered why yet.

---------------------------------------------
To the people that download this character:
---------------------------------------------
Ok, this may be my latest release in a long while, but just because I did NOT announce a NEW WIP after Android 17 has been release doesn't mean you can e-mail me with suggestions on what to work on next. Should any1 do such a request for a new WIP, i will simply delete the mail or ignore you on the IM Programs. + I also intend to upgrade my current ones maybe... MAYBE, I cam liable to change my mind ANYTIME! And no one can take charge of what I wanna work on anyway, unless they pay me ^__^. AND DO NOT USE THE SPRITES, if anyone does there would be a serious attack on the web on which ever site that the "stolen sprites used to make another character" was put on. Not just from me, but from the whole ZGTEAM!

---------------
Future Updates:
---------------
- Bug Fixes, especially on the Armor Code
- More moves
- Improved Meteor
- Aritifical Intelligence once I learn it
- Re-edit my Super 17 then make a transform/fusion character, 17 - Super 17 [and don't e-mail me about this either, gotta find the time to edit a newly improved Super 17]
- A crouch kick needed to be added :P 

---------------
How to install:
---------------
