What is the menu mode?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==
Maybe you don't like flying because your snk/capcom character can't do it...
Or maybe You consider powering up cheating because it "slows down the action"
Or maybe you wanna log onto mugen dev and bash the disciple x for having standard
dbz play...... Well not anymore!!

The Menu mode allows you to turn off certain aspects
of the character....
You can disable: 
flying
Teleportation
Powering - up
The dragonball system
Maybe This will put a stop to those whining botches who complain about
dbz game play! (I like flying and powering up!)
======================================================

The characters!!!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Dragonball Z/GT is unique, Because unlike those other "tag team" Characters,
This one does it correctly!

Why??

Because:
1.) I did no skimping!
Each character has at least 5 or more supers!

2.)Each character has his own play style!
It really is like having 3 characters in one!

3.)Each character has his own intros and win poses!!

4.) My unique Dragonball system!!
You'll be playing this character for hours trying to see
the really cool powerups or hilarious handicaps the dragonballs can
grant you!

5.)Strikers
Each character has at least 2 strikers to help him out during battle!

6.) You hate the marvel vs. capcom system of play? Turn it off!
(see snk play mode for more info)

Vegeta
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
This is the vegeta portion of this character!

Why a non super saiyan version of vegeta?

Lets face it! After vegeta went super saiyan, he basically became worthless,
never stacking up to the awesome powers of the goku family, or even his own son! So I chose the
vegeta that knows no mercy, fought his hardest and actually won alot!
This vegeta goes from when he first heard about the dragonballs from raditz and goku,
All the way up to when he left to become a super saiyan in space. The moment he turns super
saiyan, my vegeta ends there. (Maybe thats where sunboys vegeta begins or something.)
Of course if there is a demand I guess i'll make a super saiyan version of him in the next 
version update of this character....

I've noticed this vegeta plays alot like another vegeta i've seen...

In reality, sunboy's vegeta wasn't horribly bad, but it wasnt the best
either! He almost had the formula complete, but what did he do wrong?

1.) His vegeta was to slow
2.) His vegeta had no range
3.) His vegeta didnt have enough moves
4.) His vegeta was too weak

So basically, I took the idea of his rapier beam, made the start up faster, but the
beam slower.(I didnt steal his programming, just the idea)Also, I took amove from the
greatest vegeta of all time, overminds vegeta. The move was ki release.
With these combinations (and lot of disciple x innovation) I have created 
the greatest vegeta of all time!(At least until necromancer makes a vegeta)

Play style:
Vegeta's a quick and nimble fighter, with a wide range of attacks that put
space between his opponent. On ground vegeta is good, But the air is where
Vegeta shines. His air combos are unstoppable and most his moves can be done
while flying or in air. His dash is from Dbz

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Vegeta's moves:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 
Elbow dash 1 - D,DF,F, x
A powerful elbow dash. If it connects, your opponent is sent fly across the
screen, bouncing off the wall.

can be done while flying

Elbow dash 2 - D,DF,F, y
A multi hitting elbow dash.
comboability - 4/5
can be done while flying

Elbow dash 3 - D,DF,F, z
A quick elbow dash. Holding z allows vegeta to keep moving fowards
and even through a your opponent. Good for making your moves unpredictable.
comboability - 4/5
can be done while flying

Ground wave - D,DF,F, a
Vegeta makes a wave of energy explode nearby.
comboability - 4/5

Flash beam - D,DF,F, b

Garlic gun - D,DF,F, c+x Level 2
Vegeta Kicks. If your opponent is hit, vegeta charges a large beam and fires
it at his opponent.
Esentially, this is a worthless move. It cant be done in an air combo,
and if done in a super jump, the beam misses his opponent. I might delete it
in future versions.... 
comboability - 1/5
can only be done in air

Final flash X - D,DF,F, y+z Level 2
Getting dicked in the desperation attack department, I decided to
give vegeta 2 more moves. 
Vegeta Shoots a beam filled with murderous intent towards
the opponent. This move randomly generates an unblockable critical hit.
comboability - 2/5
can be done while flying

Ki release X - D,DB,B, z+y Level 1
Vegeta Jumps fowards. He then explodes in a release of energy, doing
in between 10 - 14 hits of damage.
If done in air, vegeta does not jump fowards.
This move is perfect for completing air combos.
comboability - 4/5
can be done in air

Special mode attack:
Meteor mode - a+c
Vegeta sends his opponent flying.
When you see the tapping hand, enter the next command to continue the meteor
attack. You can go upto 5, with a special finish. During the finish, rapidly tap 
a to increase the power of the final kick when you see the hand tapping.

the commands are to be entered in this order:

a+c - Start the move
a+b - goto meteor 1
x+a - goto meteor 2
x+z - goto meteor 3
a+b - goto meteor 4
B,F a - Final meteor
Tip: The vegeta that is kicking on meteor 4 is the real vegeta.

Desperation attack:
Suicide bomb - D,DF,F,D,DF,F x+y level 3 and life is less than 400
vegeta jumps up and charges up. If he charges long enough, He will
explode! This move takes 200 health from vegeta. If He is below 200 life,
he will die.

Piccolo portion of the readme!

Why piccolo?

I was going to pick from goten, gohan, trunks, or raditz, But then I
Thought: Why not piccolo? There are hardly any decent versions of piccolo out 
right now(besides necromancer's and ssonic's). So I decided to do a piccolo With
Alot of innovative and new moves. This piccolo is from Early cell saga all the way
to early gt.

Play style:
This piccolo is no good in the air. His true shining area is on the ground.

he is to slow for air combos. He has a fair range of powerful moves that keep the
opponent close for big time combat.

snk command file
=-=-=-=-=-=--==--==-=-=-===-=--
This character Defaults to the marvel Vs. capcom fighting
system. However, Maybe you dont like the versus series High hitting
Air combos, or powerhouse ground combos. Or maybe you prefer snk style of play
with it's 2 hit combos and luck supermove chaining. 
Or maybe your wanna log onto mugen dev and blast this character, saying he has mashable
super combos and air combos.

Not on my watch buddy!

The snk button setup removes the "hassle" of the vs. series style of play and
allows you to fight using well timed super moves and special moves.

There are a few thing left over in the snk cmd that is from the original:
Super jumping
limited air combo usage.

If these things annoy you, take a salt tablet or walk it off!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Each Character has his own strikers.
All strikers (except raditz)can be activated when power is greater than 1000.

(vegeta doesnt know this is his son yet) By slashing a powerful attack.

Nappa - B,F,B,c Nappa comes down to help vegeta, but vegeta relizes that nappa

Damage the opponent.

Krillen - B,F,B,c Krillen helps goku by blinding his opponent with solar flare.

==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Why did I make this character?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Recently, A little trouble has been brewing at mugen dev.
It all started shortly after my grim reaper release when sunboy 
insulted overminds godly good majin vegeta.
This pissed me off.
So all i said was that I was the god of dbz characters(next to necromancer of course)
I had no i idea of the pull that sunboy had at dev. Soon I found myself battling with
every creator at the board. The scandal only elevated when I released my kenshin.
I will admit that it needs a little work, but it was no where near as bad as some of
The "experts" made it out to be. So I continued to battle, saying that sunboys vegeta was'nt
the greatest. Eventually I swore that I would make the best dragonball z character known to
man, and set off to complete this task. Now the day is here. I have created a character that 
could be nominated for character of the month or even year, if the people who gave out the
award were'nt snk/capcom biased.(If theyre not biased, why hasn't necromancer won yet?)
All I can say is Play sunboy's vegeta, then play my character and tell me which is better.
Shoot, the vegeta alone is better than sunboy's vegeta, and thats only 32% of the formula.
Of course i'm not gonna do any untasteful special intros this time(yet), i'm just gonna
show sunboy that this is how a dbz character should be done.
Isnt it ironic that you made you made your vegeta for the same reason?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-
Legends
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
These are the programmers that I consider legends in the 
mugen community. Theyre work and generousity are used time in and time out by
many creators.

The necromancer - In his rpg, he says that electbyte are gods....
I think the necromancer is, because i'll never reach his level.

overmind - His characters are the greatest ever, and will live in infamy throught the mugen
universe!

ssonic - one of the most innovative programmers ever.

sander11177 - not sure on his name, but his yamazaki is the best snk character i've ever
played!(And thats not because i'm a yamazaki fan!)

gohanssm2 - while his characters do leave something to be desired, I use
alot of his codes (namely his smash through walls code) in my characters.
We should team up!

sorrowedge - If anyone knows of any characters made by this guy, can you tell me?

willoughby jackson - anyone the necromancer considers good must be good. 
And I wouldn't mind testing out his goku.

errors and Bugs
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-==
Note: Errors are the problems that mugen has with the character and rarely ever
affect gameplay. Bugs are problems the character has that affect game play signifigantly.

errors:
When playing as piccolo or goku and you press z or c, errors run

When piccolo's genkiretsukodan helper is on screen, explod errors run
same with the genki dama move and the eternal dragon summon
I'm not fixing this.

Bugs:
The meteor mode is not perfect....
(This has nothing to do with The last stage. 
It can be reached only by good timing.)
I'm sure there were more, I just cant remember any!
Some pics may come out disstorted or discolored(its very hard to do 3 characters on one pallette)
When playing as goku or piccolo, The character might turn into vegeta at times.(this is the biggest prob
with tag team characters....
=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Misc
