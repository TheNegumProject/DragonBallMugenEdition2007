Thanks to have downloaded Shin Buu on my site, I hope you will enjoy it. Shin Buu is 
as you should have understood Majin Buu in his original form. The sprites were ripped 
from the game DBZ : Hyper Dimension on SuperNes wich I have then edited to make a
M.U.G.E.N character. I have tried to give this character a Gameplay similar to those
from SNK games, with large possibilities of combos and where you are the one who control
completely what the character do.

ENJOY !!!
