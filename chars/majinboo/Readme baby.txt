Buu Evolve		- Not Implemented Yet (transform from majin buu to original buu)


I'm not a creator what so ever, i'm just showing my support for mugen character so i decided to make one.

The reason i made Majin Buu is because i don't see a lot of dbz character around and even so, all i see is vegeta or goku. Enough making them... i think we have so many rite...

Most of the codes are not mine, but i ripped the sprites and sounds myself... and i dont intend to take any credit for anything.

i u see any bugs, please let me know and of course tell me how to fix... like i said, im not a creator.

that's all


----- Thank you section -------

All the readmes have this section. Dont know who to thank by purpose...

Maybe FlowaGirl or [Necromancer] because of his kickass dbz char. [goku, cell, piccolo, and the awesome broli..]

Dizzy for his Vegeta. I only have his vegeta and will stick to that. No more vegeta download in the future.

hmm, that's all dbz char i have... and also to Multiman for sharing his character...
