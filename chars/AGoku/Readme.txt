To USERS:
-----

Feel free to alter/change Goku's coding, sprites, name, whatever editable in the files, but DO NOT release a "changed" version of the Goku to the public. You may only do it for your own personal use, and should not be released to the public claiming that "you" made it. One thing I will allow users to do is to create their OWN pallete [colors] for Goku. Should you create one, do not hesitate to contact me in the forums [www.hyperionx.net] [just PM or post a message on the board] and upload the pallete. I shall put it up available to download for other people.

All sprites are ripped from Super Butouden 2, with adjustments to the color and [especially] the hair. Do not take the sprites for your own use. Should you WISH to use them, again go on the forums and contact me there and I will talk it over with you. [I would NOT accept e-mail requests or Instant Messaging requests]. 

Like what you downloaded? Want to make suggestions, bug reports or ideas? GET ON TO THE FORUMs ^__^ and post about it. Any, and I mean ANY character requests will be deleted, I will not accept character requests from anyone, so don't even bother. I work and make what I want, I do not need people to tell me what to make. If you want to create something, learn M.U.G.E.N [a in depth tutorial will be available, written by ME, later on in the future].
