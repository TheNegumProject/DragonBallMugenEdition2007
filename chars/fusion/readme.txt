Who is Gogeta?

When Son Goku and Vegeta fuse together with the fusion technique.He appears in 
Movie 12 and in episode 60 of DBGT (in SSJ4 stage).He is super strong & fast, in fact he finishes his opponents in a matter of minutes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Hyper/Super Moves list: 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===>Final Kamehameha ~~~~~~  D, F, y

The classic kamehameha wave, it's a 1 hit attack and does an average damage.It takes away little ki and you can perform it easily and fast.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===>Big Bang Kamehameha ~~~~~~  D, F, x

It's a 30 hit attack easy to perform and does a massive damage to characters with 1000/1100 of life, taking away more than 1/3 of the lifebar.The Ki wave is huge compared to the other attacks, it covers all the screen most of the times, so to avoid it...well it's kinda impossible, but if you're using a character with a sort of teleport move, you can avoid it....i think :D
One last note: it uses all the ki bar, so you have to charge quite a lot in order to perform it more than once.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===>Soul Punisher  ~~~~~~  D, DF, F, z

Well, this is the most powerful move, it does lots of damage and it uses a minimum amount of ki.It's difficult to perform though, being so powerful.I tested it in arcade mode, and the character managed to complete it 4 times out of 10 tries. 
The character teleports behind the opponent and performs a flying kick, now, if gogeta is close enough and the kick hits, then he finishes the move, with the energy sphere, if not, then there will be no ki consumption and...you will have to try it again.

*note: this move will be changed and improved in version 1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===>Big Bang Attack ~~~~~~  D, F, y

A ball of energy, not easy to avoid uses very little ki and it's quite fast.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===>Ki Blast ~~~~~ s

Very fast ball of ki, 1 button move, but it does very little damage and consumes quite alot of ki, so don't kill your enemy just by firing this move, cuz it's not worth it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===>Combo ~~~~~ b+y

Gogeta performs a number of kicks and punches in a row.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===>Flying Kick ~~~~~ b+y

Powerfull kick which blows the enemy away.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Coming in version 1.0:

* Renzoku energy dan.
* Gallick Gun.
* A better combo. 
* More light efx.
* Better intro.


Thanks to....

* Pextin, for beta-testing, and for helping me a lot with the code stuff and lots of suggestions.
* Komodo, for giving me permission to use his MajinVegeta as base.
  The base i used before was awful, and since I suck in programming, well, it really helped a      lot. 
* Strife for beta testing.
* Ladykiki, for ripping the sweet sound efx from Ultimate Battle 22.
* Toad, for the great super saiyan aura.
* Flowagirl, for giving me permission (ages ago) to use some explosion efx, from the game "Garou:   Mark of the Wolves"
* Kamajin for sending me a bunch of effects, from the game Capcom vs Snk (I think, although I'm    not sure if thats the game) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:

You cannot host this character, if you are interested to do so, e-mail either me or Jedistardust and ask for permission.
If you think there is something stolen in this character, e-mail me immediately.I respect the mugen community, every stage or character done so far by me, was done exclusively with my own stuff and/or by asking permission when using other ppl's.
If there is something which i used without permission (i really doubt it, but anyway), then i will personally remove this character from my website and release any further versions only privately.  

Enjoy it! :)
