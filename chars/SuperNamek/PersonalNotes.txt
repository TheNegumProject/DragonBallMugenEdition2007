This file is used to note what my thoughts are while working on this character. They may not be 
directly related to my progress, but are some explanations and history notes as what I did. This 
file also contains any bug reports and move ideas sent to me by various people and beta testers.

-The log I've made is used to show you everything what I've done for this character.
Originally, I was already working on another project, but because there was a great number of 
requests to work on one more DBZ character, I'll do it to prevent my e-mail account from 
getting spammed again. =)

-----------
01/01/01
-----------
-The Battle Experience System is nearly complete. There are many things to take into 
consideration, and I'm running out of variables. =) (I may need to start using Float Vars...)

-I changed the rounding in the math from using "Floor", to using "Ceil". Character damage 
will now round up.

-Notes from Y2Krillen: (Move ideas)

1.Mystic attack while coming down from air like. Like the air fireball

2. Use the getting up sprites for a knee ramming move

3. Mtstic attacks to replace all the regular standing moves(these moves should push the
opponent back great distances)

4. Ultra mass smasher. Picollo gains muscles and does several hard punches and uppercuts to the opponet.
(Sprites will be based off Brolis upper torso)

5. Multi for makanksappo- Super pause occurs and a Picollo clone
appears opposite of the opponent and with you on the other side of the
opponent. Which leaves the opponent caught in between two Picollos who will
both fire mankanksappos.

6.Two more ultra combos-These really add to the whole flash fighting concept
of DBZ. It would be could if the punches/kicks would random variables. What I mean
is that the combo wouldnt be preset with say 200, 210 220. It would be much better
if the moves were either random or controlled by the player at the last moment.
I think it would be interesting if the more buttons the player spontaeneously pushes
the more attacks would be iniated. The combos shouldnt last more than 25 seconds or so.
They should also be able to be broken with other hyper combos, supers, ki dishcharge ect..

7. Clones should deplete Picollos health by about 5%. And take away a level
two amount of energy.

8.<<TAKEN FROM ULTIMATER DBZ INFORMATION SITE>>
Kakusan Yuudou Kikou Ha- This is one of Piccolo's coolest attacks. He sends
hundreds of energy balls into the air and surrounds his opponent with them.
The energy balls hang in mid-air for a second, and then he lets fly. He forces
all of the energy balls to converge on his victim at once causing a large
explosion. This would be a great finisher super. We could hype it up by adding
multiple smoke clouds. My idea for it is a super pause and then Picollo does the
the move, about 30 seconds later the bombs home in on the opponent.

9. A preset combo where you execute the button command and picollo dashes toward opponent uppercuts 
them in air and then zanzokens where they would apppear in air, then smashes them into ground with a 
air kick. Then releases a continous stream of ki blasts. Variations on this move could be replacing 
the multiple fireballs with the mankanksappo or giant fireball.

10. Bigger, and better smoke clouds. I'm thinking half the size of the screen.

-Announced my project on MugeNow. (Thanks to Ribeiro for translating my post into 
Portuguese.)

-The Battle Experience System is now completed. I'll have to double check the explanation I've made 
before teaching MugeNow how it is done. (This system is still under testing.)

-I now have Mattasaur's authorization in using his MOTW hit sounds, just in case. =)

-----------
01/06/01
-----------
-Getting some errors in using the equation:
S(Ceil(Var(34)),0))

Where Var(34) had a value of 5. I cannot override the group with an equation.

Now changed to:
Ceil(Var(34)),0)

Where Var(34) now has a value of 15. (Group 5 goes under the "Fight.SND" default sounds group.)

-Changed the sound equation again. Ceil is not required in setting sound values. (I forgot to remove it.) 

It is now:
S(Var(34)),0

The sounds now work great. =)

-----------
01/07/01
-----------
-The Number System is now implemented, and working quite well. =) I'll have to come up with a different 
way of gaining experience more efficiently. 

-The trigger, "MoveHit" does not register until a the hit pause for the opponent has ended. During 
combos, the experience gained is not added from the combined hits, but will register only the last attack.

-----------
01/08/01
-----------
-Heh, I just remembered about the "ignorehitpause" option. This solved my MoveHit problem. =)

-Notes from Y2Krillen: (Piccolo's Story)

Piccolo (Ma Jyunia "Demon Junior")- Piccolo is the reincarnation of his father Piccolo Daimaou. 
Many people think it's a plot hole that Kami is still alive after Daimaou is killed. Well it's not 
because Daimaou lives on in Piccolo. Piccolo retains all of his father's memories and abilities, 
however, he does have something that his father didn't. A conscience. When Piccolo first appears 
during the 23rd Tenkaichi Budoukai, he's severely brutal and seriously has it in for Gokou.

Raditz Saga/Sayain Saga
The next time he shows up to assist Gokou in defeating Raditzu, he still has no feelings for Gokou 
and would kill him just as soon as he'd kill Raditzu.....which....uh...he does. But that's besides 
the point. The point is, he still leads his own evil path which is being obstructed by the Saiya-jin, 
so he's forced to train Gokou's child to be a warrior. As the one year of training progresses, 
Piccolo becomes attached to the child, but never ONCE hints to it. (As opposed to the English 
version where he practically pampers the kid). Piccolo finally becomes reformed when he sacrafices 
his life to save Gohan's. From that moment, he loses his desire to conquer the Earth. While dead, 
Picollo is allowed to train with Kiaosama on his tiny planet. Here Picollo doesnt really train 
with Kaiosama, but does his own training. After being wished back to life and onto the Planet 
Namek, Piccolo merges with the dying Nail increasing his power level over 1,000,000 allowing him to 
go one-on-one with Stage 2 Freeza. After freeza transforms into 4th and final form, Picollo is 
overpowered and it was up to Goku to finish the fight.

Andriod Saga (beginning of the Cell Saga)
Picollo trains with Gohan and Goku in preparation for a battle that will happen three years in the 
future with two killer andriods. So until that day came he was training with Gohan and Goku.

3 years later when the Andriods finally surfaced, the Z fighters were all stronger than ever. Vegeta 
destroys Andriod #19. And Picollo defeats Android #20( aka Dr.Gero ) easily. He would have finished 
off the android, but #20 fled for his life.

And in the middle of the Android Saga, he merges with his other half, Kami, to fight off Imperfect Cell. 
From this fusion he is stronger than any Super Sayain and has great knowledge. His battle with Imperfect 
Cell comes to an end after Cell retreats, fearing that Picollo was too powerful for him. Very soon after 
he faces off against Andriod #17. The purpose of this fight is to keep the three Andriods ( Andriod 18, 
17, and 16) from finding Goku and Gohan who are on Kami뭩 look out. The two are very close in power 
levels and the battle is even all the way through. This battle is ended when Imperfect Cell returns, 
fully charged up from absorbing  hundreds of people. He tries to absorb Andriod 17 but is stopped by 
Picollo and his new attack, (Giant fireball/beam he shoots from his chest). Cell Survives the attack 
and blasts Picollo into a  near by ocean. At this point everyone thought Picollo was dead but Goku 
teleports down and saves him.

Picollo's next time of training is in the room of spirit of time. In this room one day equals one hour. 
He trains here for one fully day and becomes much stronger. But not quite as strong as Perfect Cell.

A few days later he and other Z fighters are at Cell Games. Gohan is just about to finish off Cell of 
with his kamehameha. And Picollo tries to aid Gohan but is swatted away repeatedly.

Misc...
His various mergings do not change him physically, but internally he retains the memories of both Kami 
and Nail. After merging with Kami, Piccolo becomes even more philosophical than he normally is, and 
takes actions that put him in danger for the sake of the Earth, (such as sealing himself, Gotenks and 
Buu in the Room of Spirit and Time). After fusing with Kami, Piccolo makes Kami's Palace his home, and 
he always has a special place for Gohan in his heart through all of Dragon Ball.

-SorrowEdge gives me his authorization on using his SFA number fonts. They're the 
only small enough fonts to use anyhow. =D

-I definitely need to find a better hit/guard sound set for Piccolo's Variable Mode. 
The sounds from SFA sound too weak. =P

-----------
01/16/01
-----------
-I received an e-mail from SSJ x4 Goku, who volunteered to make some edited 
sprites of Piccolo. (Adds in cape and turban) As of now, a few sprites were sent 
to me. These included colour alterations.

-Made a post on the DB3K, showing my WIP. I also made a post a few days earlier, 
in Mugen DEV. However, a flame war started, about "Preference" issues...

-----------

-The Constants Index is getting too large to put in the CNS file. I made a separate 
text file for this, for easier reference.

-Notes from Kakaroto: (Piccolo Test 002)
	Piccolo is too slow!
	Offered to make the ending sequence
	
-Did a bit of research. =P

I'll be using all of the Meteor Smash combos of DBZ2 and add them to Piccolo. Because 
they are simply devastating combos, it'll still suit him. =) As for DBZ3, I have no 
idea how the Meteor Smash combos are done. (Or they don't exist...)

Meteor Smash Description: (Slightly edited to suit Piccolo's sprites.) 

All commands for these Meteor Smash moves are: B, F, D, U, punch/kick. However, because 
this command is too difficult to execute, most of these commands will be in a double motion 
format. (Eg. D, DF, F, D, DF, F)

Gohan/Goku:
	MK
	SK (Knock opponent up diagonal)
	Appear over opponent
	Falling 1 sprite
	SK (Upside down)/AP (Knock opponent down diagonal)
	Stay flying

Vegeta:
	WP (No AnimElem 3)
	CSP (Knock opponent up)
	Appear over opponent
	AK (Knock opponent down diagonal)
	Appear on ground near opponent
	WK (Knock opponent straight)

Trunks:
	WK (Knock opponent straight)
	Dash (Until hits opponent)
	SK (VelSet of 2/3, for sliding)
	WK (Knock opponent straight)

Cell:
	None (That I found...)

Cell Jr:
	(Same as Cell)

Zangya:
	MK
	CSP/SK (Knock opponent up, then fall)
	CSP (Knock opponent up diagonal, then fall)

Bojack:
	CK
	SK/CSP (Knock opponent up)
	Appear over opponent
	AK (Knock opponent down diagonal)
	Stay flying

Broli:	(I will definitely not add this to Piccolo. This is one of Broli's signature moves.)
	SK (Knock opponent up)
	Jump up
	Grab opponent's head, then fall to the ground with opponent held
	Smashes the opponent head into the ground

-Chinese New Year! =)

-Notes from Y2Krillen: (Piccolo Test 003)
	Meteor Smash 2 Bug: Opponent is able to escape before the last hit, after the throw.
	Sent a Piccolo edited sprite of Kami Sama. (Looking great!)
	Gave a link for sound samples of Piccolo: 

-Added in my e-mail notes from various people. (Piccolo moves, ideas, etc...)

-During the time 0f Jan 29 to Feb 2, I took a bit of a break in character making, and started
my new web site. =)

-----------
02/05/01
-----------
-Piccolo [Ver 02/05/01] is now released. I can now work on Freeman a bit more, but I'll 
continue on Piccolo as well...

-----------
02/11/01
-----------
-Piccolo [Ver 02/11/01] is now released. Enough moves and changes have been made to make such a quick update. =)

-----------
02/12/01
-----------
-Very strange: State 9000 cannot be used for some odd reason. The engine doesn't seem to detect it. I had to change this to
9001...

-----------
02/20/01
-----------
-Received some edited Piccolo sprites from SSJx4 Goku. (Very well made...)

-----------
02/23/01
-----------
-WBJ discovered an idea about custom state animations: Use a -2 state, ChangeAnim parameter when in these custom
states. (Fixes the animation problems.)

-----------
02/25/01
-----------
-BlackShinobi reported a bug in Piccolo. Quote:

E-mail: Piccolo/Bug

To The Necromancer,

    Hey, great work on piccolo. The new moves are perfect. While playing, I noticed a small bug. It is in [Statedef 8225]. 
When the returning projectile hits, the oponent moves forward instead of back. I fixed it already, but I just wanted you
to know about it.

You just needed the (-) for the x value.

ground.velocity = -5
guard.velocity = -2.5
air.velocity = -5,-1
airguard.velocity = -2.5

-----------
02/27/01
-----------
-WBJ's feedback:
	More physical moves, and less projectile types needed.
	Meteor Smash 5: Does not hit all opponents.
	Extending Arm recommended: Billy Kane style attacks.
	Head Pos too high for Piccolo. (Since Piccolo IS a DBZ character, he's too short. =P)

-----------
03/11/01
-----------
-KenmastersX sent an e-mail, giving me a ZSNES movie of Cell's meteor combo. (Since I could never do it.)
He also suggested that I try to make some meteos from DBZ3, since they look much more impressive. =)

-Ribeiro finally got back in Mugen. (Computer crash.) With that in mind, I can now get my ReadMe file translated. =P

-WBJ's new version of Goku is awesome! Goku has a pretty neat intro. I made Piccolo interact with this. (One of the first characters
in Mugen to have a "true" intro interaction!)

-----------
03/15/01
-----------
-The Flash Battle and Grappling Modes can be very buggy for some characters. These will be fixed in the future...

-----------
03/17/01
-----------
-Piccolo's signature move, the Makankosapppo, is now completed. (Highly graphical too!) This is very different from most
multi-hit projectiles, as it actually extends from Piccolo. The projectile cuts through the opponent if the opponent dies.

-BlackShinobi sent me some alternate animations for Piccolo's Grappling Mode. That feedback was sure fast!

-Daeyrat's feedback:
	Add Team Battle moves
	Increase Piccolo's speed
	Adjust the Exp System

-----------
03/31/01
-----------
-I was being lazy for the last number of days... =P

I finally gotten back in working with Piccolo though, but not by much.

-Notes from Daeyrat:

E-mail: Test

Genki Dama ? You mean Gekiretsukodan or Chou Bakuretsuhama...
Here큦 an idea for it: If Piccolo keeps charging for ??? secs after saiying
GEKIRETSUKODAN the blast will be more powerful and will have different
sprites
In the Anime, Ki Blast can be charged and Piccolo큦 Gekiretsukodan was a
Giant Ki BEAM
If he charges for:
3 secs : Blast + Sparks, 2x Faster
6 secs : Beam
9 Secs : Beam + Sparks
12 secs : Shinkuu Hadouken
15 Secs : Capcom Games Giant Beam

The time needed will decrease when Piccolo gets more powerful (Exp.)
Also, it큦 hard to do, but... Piccolo would be FASTER too if Exp. Number
Increase... Fast Move = Faster Zanzoken Too

Knee Counter is too weak
Capcom still doesn큧 have Gekiretsukodan

-2nd e-mail from Daeyrat:

E-mail: More

-Diagonal Makakousappo and Gekiretsukodan (And other Hyper Moves ater)
 
-New Moves (Based on Piccolo.txt)
 
-Chyou Kyosjin Jyutsu >Piccolo's special ability to increase his body size to the height of an apartment 
 
-Kizuato no Chiyu
 
-Mystic Punch - Another Variation of Extending Arm Move. It큦 like DBZ Hyper Dimension큦 attack but the enemy falls
 
-Psychokinesis > Psy Grab (Levitate). In mugen , this works like Cell ( Hyper Dimension) 큦 Psy Attack but Piccolo only throws the enemy , no psi attacks,  only throw
 
-Telepathy - The ability to communicate others by speaking to them through their mind.In mugen, he calls someone . This person will shoot a beam ( VS Games Helper System). Helpers : Goku or Gohan
 
-Bakuriki Demon Blast :Original Piccolo Attack
 
-Exploding Demon Cannon : Original Piccolo Attack
 
-Tamago o Omu - shoot egg and give birth to another namekian (can be a "Special Death". This happens when a Goku (ribeiro or wbj) kills him, so he shoots an egg )
 
-Toomi no Jyutsu-The psychic ability to sense what's going on in a different part of the world : In mugen it can be a special move like this:
When he큦 flying really high you do a command , then hold the button, as long as you hold it, The enemy will be shown instead of you (It큦 useful to see the enemy when you큥e flying high)
 
-Makankousappo Fatality : When the Beam goes through the enemy, blood effects...
 
-Higher Flying Limits
 
-DBZ Extras : Mini Jump is also included in DBZ . It큦 also in DBZ HD

-I received another e-mail from Daeyrat:

E-mail: More

Gekiretsukodan : 4 Levels ( Not 6)
Each higher level needs more Energy and gives more experience
1 - Fireball - level 2
2 - Vegeta Final Flash Sprites  Beam - 3
3 - Goku Chou Kamehame Ha Sprites Beam - 4
4 - Giant Beam (Capcom) - 5
 
Kakikesu - Change the command because it큦 hard to do the Meteor (I suggest F,D+Punch).
Also, Decrease it큦 dispersion range to half screen and Piccolo큦 Ki hurts (Ki Burn)
 
-Broli큦 Autoturn System (Piccolo큦 always looking at the enemy) - Mystic Mode
 
-Ki Charge - when he charges TOO much (when there큦 time enough to fill a 6 level bar) , shockwaves, dark screen, some rocks start to lift, Sparks... 
 
.DBZ MODE Extra : Energy Auto Refill
