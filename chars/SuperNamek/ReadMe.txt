========================================================================
If you bought this character from an auction, or from any person 
whosoever, you've been ripped off. As far as I'm concerned, Mugen 
is 100% free. 
========================================================================

And...

========================================================================
You are free to modify and/or distribute Piccolo, and his work files, 
just as long as you have a mention in my name when appropriate.
This does NOT mean that you may copy all of his moves, or edit his SFF 
file and release it as your own. 
========================================================================

I wouldn't want to see a "Piccolo Style" Goku. Even if you're planning to give me 
credit for using Piccolo as a base, I wouldn't want it anyhow. (So, don't use him...)
Yes, it is considered stealing if I am not aware that you're using Piccolo as a base, and
release him to the public...

Please do not copy Piccolo's move code for code. I made him for people to learn, 
not to steal from. =)

Notes:

========================================================================
Important: This "Reference Character" is not intended for beginners. 
This is recommended for those of the intermediate/advanced level, as 
this character uses many math equations, as well as many variables. 
(See "Constants Index" for a complete index of his variables.) 
========================================================================

Wow, advanced codes from a DBZ character? =P

If for some reason, you plan to give me an award for this character, (Ha! Like that would happen!)
don't. I won't accept any awards. That's not why I made Piccolo...

Piccolo's Story:
----------------------
(As read from Planet Namek - http://www.planetnamek.com)

The Piccolo in the DBZ series is the sole offspring of Piccolo-Daimao from 
the original. Like his father, his intentions are evil. However, when Raditsu 
threatens the Earth, he turns to the side of good and helps Goku. He later 
trains Gohan, and the kid helps Piccolo become a good, well-meaning person. 
Capable of regenerating body parts and manipulating his size and shape, 
Piccolo is a formidable fighter. 

------------
Features:
------------

==============
Battle Experience System:
==============
	-Gain experience as you progress though the game.
	-Strength is increased as more experience is gained.

==============
Dizzy Feature:
==============
	-When hit enough times, Piccolo will become dizzy.
	-If Piccolo does many Kikou Ha projectile within a short period of time, he will become exhausted.
	-Press any button repeatedly to get out of dizzy state.

==============
Guard Crush:
==============
	Guarding is limited. Go into dizzy state if limit is reached.

==============
Critical Hit:
==============
	Press any button if any projectile hits the opponent.

==============
Custom BG Music:
==============
	Characters supported by this are:

	Piccolo's Theme Music:
		-Kung Fu Man, by Elecbyte
		-Freeman, by me. (Currently unreleased)
		-Any character with the name "Piccolo", or my version of Piccolo.
		-Any character with the name "Nail", or my version of Nail. (Which is currently the ONLY version around!)
		-Any character with the name "Goku", or WilloughByJackson's and Ribeiro's versions of Goku.

	Broli's Theme Music:
		-The Necromancer, by me. (Currently unreleased)
		-Intangir, by me. (Currently unreleased)
		-Any character with the name "Broli", or Kuzu-bei's version of Broli.

==============
Fighting Modes:
==============
	Balance, Variable, and Combination fighting styles:
		Combination Mode: DBZ Style fighting
		Variable Mode: VS Style fighting
		Balanced Mode: SNK Style fighting

	Sub-Modes:
		Combination Mode: (Anything goes!)
		-None

		Variable Mode: (Increased combo ability)
		-V-Ism: Increases character's speed, and creates more flexibility in combos.

		Balanced Mode: (Increased power, decrease in combo ability)
		-None

===============
Life Persistency: (In the 3rd and higher rounds, regardless of what Piccolo had in the previous rounds, he will have full life.)
===============
	Like in the KOF and KI games, Piccolo will retain his life values throughout the next round if he
wins. This makes it more difficult to beat the opponent twice in a row. >=D

===============
Flash Battle: (Please note, this is a HIGHLY experimental feature.)
===============
	As in Dragonball Z: Hyper Dimension, if Piccolo is hit during his attack, he and the opponent
will go into a struggle. This also occurs if Piccolo is guarding a lot, or if the opponent does his recovery
move during Piccolo's Combination meteo combos. (If Piccolo has a lower life value compared to the opponent.)

	When this happens, start jamming those buttons! More damage will be done to the opponent.
Whomever presses the button the most times, will win the battle. The character who loses the struggle will
become dizzy.

==============
Grappling Mode:
==============
	(From Super Boutuden 3, with some changes) If Piccolo  meets the opponent dashing, while the
opponent is either walking, or also dashing, they will go into a struggle. Press any button rapidly to win the
struggle. If the struggle is unsettled in 3 seconds, both characters will go into flash battle.
