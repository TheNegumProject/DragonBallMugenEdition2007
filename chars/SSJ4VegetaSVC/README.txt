Notes
-----
1.I created this char using the Snk Vs Capcom template.
2.I tried to make him as a mixture of DBZ AND SVC,with DBZ's awesome attacks and specials and SVC's cool modes,tactics and combos,
this is the first SVC style character im making,so excuse the lack of knowledge about the system.
3.There are two pallets,Dark Vegeta And SSJ5 Vegeta,i made them for fun and didnt include them in the def file,however,if
you want to use them just edit the def file.
