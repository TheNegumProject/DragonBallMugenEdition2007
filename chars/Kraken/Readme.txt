- contact: potsmugen@yahoo.com.br
- customized version of Kraken from Sega's Shining Force 2, for Linux and Windows Mugen 



=====<Features>=====

- Same attacks as in the original game, obviously adapted to work in a fighting game
- Can spawn up to 4 limbs at the same time, which can follow and attack the opponents
- Intro, win pose and taunt (...don't kill me for those)
- Floor is replaced with water when fighting this char, plus other chars stand on floating
planks O_o
- 9 palettes



=====<Movelist>=====

AQUA-BREATH: [x] or [a]
   Kraken spits out dozens of bubbles for some nice damage. Best used to force the opponent
to retreat, or to cause chip damage. The bubbles' trajectory can be directed by holding the
backward or forward directions.
   Repeating the command will make it interrupt the move and regain control. Attempting to
repeat the move while bubbles are still active will just make it spit air.

DIVE: D,D
   Kraken submerges, becoming completely invulnerable. While submerged, Kraken will send out
its limbs automatically until none are left, at which point it will resurface automatically.
Most opponents can also taunt to force it to resurface.
   Pressing up will make it resurface, which can hit a nearby opponent.
   Cannot be used when it runs out of limbs.

USE LEG: [y] or [b]
   One of Kraken's legs appears on surface at a random position. Can hit an opponent as it
bursts out of water, and after that it stays on screen, moving and attacking automatically
until it's destroyed.
   See the Details section. Legs are faster, but weaker than arms.

USE ARM: [z] or [c]
   One of Kraken's arms appears on surface at a random position. Can hit an opponent as it
bursts out of water, and after that it stays on screen, moving and attacking automatically
until it's destroyed.
   See the Details section. Arms are slower than legs, but are stronger and have better range.

DASH: F,F or B,B
   Performs a quick dash that goes through opponents. Best used to avoid getting cornered.

TAUNT: start
   Kissy kissy.



=====<Details>=====

  I don't know, you can call it a joke/bonus char. Shining Force 2 is one of my favourite games
ever, plus I felt like coding something different, so here you have it.

  Its gameplay consists on summoning limbs to attack the opponents while trying to keep a
distance to avoid their attacks.
  Kraken only loses hit points when hit on the head. Hitting its limbs only makes it lose
those. Also, the head has hyper armor but the limbs don't.

  Limbs act as helpers, automatically getting close to opponents and attacking them.
  They can be hit, and will be destroyed if they take a certain ammount of damage.
  There are two kinds of limbs, arms and legs, each with different attributes as follows:

    Limb     Strength     Speed     Range    Hit Points  Ammount
Legs       |  Medium  |  Medium  |  Medium  |   200    |    8
Arms       |  Strong  |  Slow    |  Long    |   300    |    2

  Ammount refers to how many of each you can spawn (in total, not at a time), so this means
for example that once you've spawned 2 arms, you can't spawn anymore of them. You can in the
next round, however.



=====<Version History>=====

<Version 1.2>
- A lot of balance changes
- Remade the Hyper Armor so that Kraken is no longer stunned by every attack
- Tweaked some Clsn boxes, affecting priority, recovery time, etc of some moves
- It's now easier to jump over it
- Low attacks like Reppuken no longer miss it
- Can now submerge to avoid attacks
- Bubbles now pop if attacked by an opponent
- Can now summon limbs at any time
- Decreased limb's hit points
- Limbs now attack as soon as they get close enough, but cause less damage
- Limbs are now pushed back when hit. This makes them both harder to kill and less annoying
- Limbs now have a new attack
- Arms are now slower than legs
- Legs are now affected by corner push
- Prevented a bug that could happen when a char used a ReversalDef on Kraken's limbs
- Added a missing sprite, and a frame to the large portrait
- 3 new palettes that also change the water color
- Fancy move descriptions on the movelist

<Version 1.0>
- Some small fixes
- No longer creates water floor when not necessary, like when facing another Kraken or
N-Mario's Killer Whale
- Plank sprites will now appear bigger if the opponent is too big for it
- Kraken's partners now also fight on floating planks
- Bubble Spray now aims faster
- Added a bunch of sounds
- Tentacles are now smarter and act faster, making the char a bit harder to beat
- Tentacles can now hit the opponent as they surface from the water. Can hit downed opponents
- Legs now have a bit less HP
- Nicer water color
- Bubble Spray now ends a bit sooner if there's an opponent behind Kraken, so that weak spot
isn't so weak anymore

<Version 0.9>
- First release



=====<What's Missing>=====

- Tweaking the latest changes
- Maybe make it an A.I. only char, or give it an A.I.
- Whatever comes up



=====<Special Thanks>=====
